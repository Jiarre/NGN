# Network Security #

This folder contains exercises for packet filter and secure network tunnels. As
technologies, we use nftables and Wireguard to give a hands-on introduction with
state of the art implementations for packet filters and secure network tunnels.
The exercises should be completed in ascending order, starting with exercise 1.
Besides these exercises there exist also an example implementation for both in
the ../../examples folder (nftables.py and wireguard.py).



This folder contains the following files:

1. Three exercises for the packet filter

2. Two exercises for secure network tunnels

3. A folder with the solutions to the exercise


The exercises are annotated with TODO and a description that tell you what kind
of protection should be implemented at that location. The book chapter offers
more detailed explanations on how to solve the exercises.
